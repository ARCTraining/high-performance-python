## Notes on High Performance Python course

  * The perceived problems with Python
  * Profiling code- how to identify the 'problem areas' or potential slow-running areas in code
  * Performance differences between Python lists, arrays and Numpy arrays
  * Speeding up code 1: The benefits of numpy
  * Speeding up code 2: Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compilation with Cython
  * Speeding up code 3: Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation with numba
  * Design choices- choosing the right algorithm for the job (big O notation)
  * Final thoughts and other ideas:
    * Why not just write it in C?
    * Use a specialist language to write native functions, eg. Chapel for parallel programming or Julia for general purpose performant code.
